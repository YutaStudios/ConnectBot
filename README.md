## ℹ️ Why We Can't Use GitHub
We cannot use GitHub for hosting the full application files because the file size exceeds GitHub's limits. A quality program with comprehensive features and functionality naturally results in larger file sizes. Programs with extensive capabilities, rich user interfaces, multiple dependencies, and robust feature sets often exceed the standard repository size constraints that GitHub imposes. This is why we've opted to use Google Drive as our primary distribution method to ensure you can access the complete, fully-featured version of Connect Bot.
